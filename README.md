# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Functionality

- User registration and login (with hashed passwords)

- Authorization middleware to protect routes

- CRUD operations for clothing items

- Associate clothing items with users

- Weather integration ready for frontend to consume

- Centralized error handling and validation

## Technologies & Techniques Used

- Node.js – JavaScript runtime

- Express.js – Web framework for handling routes and middleware

- MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing users and items

- Mongoose – ODM for MongoDB

- Nodemon – Development tool for automatic server reload

- RESTful API Design – Resource-centric endpoints with clear HTTP verbs

- Environment variables for configuration (e.g., port, database URI)

- Data Validation – Strong input validation at the request level
